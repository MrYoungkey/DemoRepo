        Coffee and tea are two of the most widely consumed beverages 
        in the world. Both are brewed from natural sources and have 
        been enjoyed for centuries. However, they differ in terms of their
        taste, aroma, and health benefits.
        Coffee is a popular beverage known for its strong, 
        bitter taste and stimulating effect. It contains caffeine, 
        which is a natural stimulant that can help increase alertness
        and reduce fatigue. Coffee is often consumed in the morning 
        as a pick-me-up or throughout the day to boost energy levels.
        It can be enjoyed hot or cold, with milk or cream, 
        and can be prepared in various ways, such as drip coffee, 
        espresso, or French press.
